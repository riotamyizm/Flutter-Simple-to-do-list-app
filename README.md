# Flutter Simple To-Do List App

Hi there! 👋  
This is a **simple To-Do List app built with Flutter**, created mainly for study and practice purposes. It helped me learn more about Flutter basics like state management, UI building, and working with lists.

If you’re new to Flutter and want a starting point for a simple productivity app, this might be useful for you too. 😊

## 📌 What This App Does

This app lets you:

- 📝 **Add tasks**
- ✅ **View your task list**
- ❌ **Remove tasks**
- ✔️ **Mark tasks as done**  
Because this is mainly a study project, it doesn’t have persistent storage or advanced features — but it’s a solid foundation to expand from!

## 🚀 Tech & Tools

- **Flutter & Dart** — UI framework and language  
- **Stateless & Stateful widgets**  
- **ListView to show tasks**  
- **Basic UI & interaction patterns**  
- Works on Android, iOS, and other Flutter platforms

(So far it doesn’t include a local database or cloud sync — but you *could* add that later 👍)
